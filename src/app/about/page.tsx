        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-400">🚀 What is Crypto Kombat?</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Crypto Kombat is a <span className="font-bold">high-stakes, battle-driven trading competition</span> where participants 
          fight for profits in short, intense tournaments. Each round resets the playing field, 
          ensuring a <span className="font-bold">fair and competitive</span> experience.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Unlike traditional trading competitions, Crypto Kombat is designed to be <span className="font-bold">transparent, secure, and fair</span>.  
          Liquidity is locked, competition is skill-based, and every tournament provides a fresh start for all traders.
        </p>

      {/* Why We Created Crypto Kombat */}
      <div className="mt-10 w-full max-w-5xl bg-gray-800 p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-400">🎯 Why We Built This</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The inspiration behind Crypto Kombat came from seeing the <span className="font-bold">same cycles</span> in crypto:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed list-disc pl-6">
          <li>💰 Hyped meme coins that vanish overnight.</li>
          <li>🚨 Rug pulls leaving buyers with nothing.</li>
          <li>📉 Unfair competitions where insiders dominate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We wanted to build a project that is <span className="font-bold">transparent, fair, and skill-based</span>.  
          Crypto Kombat eliminates rug pulls and ensures every trader has a real chance at success.

      {/* How It Works */}
      <div className="mt-10 w-full max-w-5xl bg-gray-800 p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-400">⚡ How It Works</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Each tournament consists of <span className="font-bold">3 rounds</span>, lasting <span className="font-bold">4 days each</span>.  
          Traders battle for the <span className="font-bold">top 5 leaderboard spots</span>, while the <span className="font-bold">biggest loser</span> also wins a prize.
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed list-disc pl-6">
          <li>🏆 Trade to earn the most profit in the round.</li>
          <li>💥 Buy & sell tax (10%) funds rewards, LP, and development.</li>
          <li>🔒 Liquidity is locked for the entire round.</li>
          <li>⏳ Final hour mass sell-off ensures fairness before LP unlocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The locked liquidity and structured sell-off prevent any traders from getting stuck holding the bag.  
          Any remaining liquidity is <span className="font-bold">added to the prize pool</span>, making rewards even bigger.
